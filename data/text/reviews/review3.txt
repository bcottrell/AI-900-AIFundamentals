Safety Warnings, Cautions and Notes
SCU-GG000080 / Issue 4 July 2015
The following are the safety warnings and cautions relating to the RAMM products; single VHF, 
single UHF and Dual VHF/UHF antenna mast systems:
Warnings
• Risk Of Electrocution: Do not erect the mast close to, or beneath, overhead power lines. 
• Radhaz: A radhaz exclusion zone of 1m should be established around the base of the antenna when 
in use.
• Electric Storms: During electric storms when there is a threat of lightning strikes do not use the 
mast, as the mast presents a conduction path and increased risk of lightning attachment. If possible, 
and safe to do so, remove the RF feeder cable.
• Manual Handling: The antenna mast kit weighs approximately 7kg, care should be taken when 
handling it to prevent risk of injury. 
• Manual Handling: When unrolling and rolling the mast, it should be placed such that if it slips and 
begins to unroll it cannot impact with personnel or equipment.
• Trip Hazard: The cables and guy ropes present a trip hazard, take care when locating, using, 
assembling and disassembling the mast.
• Cut Hazard: The guy pegs have a sharp end to them, care is to be taken to avoid the risk of injury.
• Drop Hazard: Only erect the mast using the supplied guy ropes, collars and pegs. Failure to do this 
could result in the mast collapsing and causing injuries.
• Drop Hazard: The recommended maximum wind speed for the mast with the secondary cuff fitted 
and properly erected as per these instructions is 60 mph. Operation beyond this is not advised as the 
mast may fall causing injuries.
• Only use the mast in the vertical axis.
• Ensure there are no underground hazards prior to guy peg insertion.
Cautions
• The karabiners fitted to the RF connection cables should be clipped onto the strain relief loops fitted 
on the mast before connecting RF plugs. This prevents accidental damage to the RAMM RF cable 
plug should a pull force be applied to the coaxial cable 
• The recommended maximum wind speed for the mast with the secondary cuff fitted and properly 
erected as per these instructions is 60 mph. Operation beyond this is not advised as the mast may 
fall causing injuries.
• Do not use solvents to clean the product.
• During operation, and once the mast is set up, keep a safe distance away in case of mast collapse. 
Safe distance is defined as 10m from base.
• Do not store items on top of the masts, either rolled or unrolled.
• Do not allow the mast to bend.
• Do not allow the mast to drop from the vertical onto hard surfaces, as this risks damage to it. If this 
does occur, a thorough inspection of the mast and all ancillaries should be carried out, with any parts 
suspected or known to have been damaged being replaced.

Checks and Maintenance
SCU-GG000080 / Issue 4 July 2015
Pre Use Checks
• Ensure all guy ropes are undamaged, free of fraying and not crushed.
• Ensure RF cables are not kinked, cut or otherwise damaged.
• Check RF connectors to ensure they are free of moisture, dirt and debris and that they are not 
physically damaged.
• Ensure the guy rope pegs are free of bends and major kinks.
• Ensure the strain relief loops are intact and undamaged (see step 12 for a picture of this feature).
• Ensure the collar and End Cap are undamaged.
Whilst unrolling the mast, check for damage to it, any holes or excessive fraying observed.
Post Use Checks
• Ensure all guy ropes are undamaged, free of fraying and not crushed.
• Ensure RF cables are not kinked, cut or otherwise damaged.
• Check RF connectors to ensure they are free of moisture, dirt and debris and that they are not 
physically damaged.
• Ensure the mast is free of dirt and debris prior to rolling it up.
Maintenance
• All cables and guy ropes should be checked prior to deployment to ensure they are free from damage 
and are clean. Damaged equipment should be replaced.
• Check the base and collar for signs of damage or degradation, replace these if any are found.
• The mast should be unwound and checked for damage and cleaned every 6 months. If the mast is 
found to be damaged please contact Selex ES for further investigation.
• All equipment should cleaned using a warm soapy solution and soft cloth. Do not use solvents to 
clean the product.

Deployment Instructions – 2 person set-up
1(1st person) Place mast 
between feet. Turn the 
open face of mast into 
the direction of the wind. 
Unwind the mast approx. 
1m and hold in position.
4 Identify the top collar locating holes above 
the first antenna patch and approx. 2m 
from the top of the mast.
Identify the top collar – when open it will 
have two lugs on the internal ring which will 
fit into the locating holes.
2 (2nd person) Place the top collar on the ground next to 
the mast. Use the perlon hoops to gauge direction of 
guy ropes. Unwind 7.5m guy ropes (no orange tag on 
guy tidy) and peg in place (angle pegs) approx. 4m from 
the centre of the mast. Ensure guys are slack and bring 
the clip end towards the centre.
3 (1st person) Elevate the mast vertically until the first 
antenna patch is at head height.

6 Attach the guy rope clips to the 
perlon hoops on the collar.
7 Unwind 5.5m guy ropes 
(identified by an orange 
tag) and peg (angle pegs) 
in place approx. 3m from 
the centre of the mast.
5 Place the top collar on the mast and 
secure. (Make sure the perlon hoops 
are at the bottom).
8 Raise the mast vertically until the second patch is at head 
height. Fit the secondary cuff (identified by the orange 
rubber patches on the inner ring) at the position shown 
by the black line on the outer cover and close outer arms 
with rubber toggle. Note – there are no locating lugs on 
this collar, perlon hoops should be at the bottom.
Continued on next page >
9 Run the mast 
up vertically 
to full height. 
Ensure that 
the open side 
of the mast 
is facing into 
the prevailing 
wind.
SCU-GG000080 / Issue 4 July 2015

Deployment Instructions Continued
The dual band mast has 2x cables. Attach these to the 
connectors located 1.8m above the base of the mast.
The single masts (VHF and UHF) have 1 x cable which 
connects to the connector located 1.8m above ground 
level. Note – always attach the metal karabiners before 
connecting the cable. This prevents weight strain on 
the connectors.
Place the End Cap on the 
base of the mast (this will 
require two people. One 
person to lift the mast and 
the other to slide the End Cap 
onto the end of the mast). 
Secure the End Cap with 3 
pegs. (Person holding mast 
must continue holding mast 
until guy ropes are secure).
10
12
Tighten up both 
sets of guy ropes 
so the mast is 
held firm and 
vertically (use the 
line-lock to ensure 
guy ropes stay 
locked in place).
Mast system fully 
deployed.

Withdrawal Instructions
1 To disconnect the cables begin by removing the 
connectors, then the karabiner from the perlon hoops. 
Weight is taken on the karabiner instead of the connectors.
4 Remove all the secondary cuff guy ropes from the pegs. 
Take control of one of the top collar guy ropes, unpeg, and 
using the guy rope to control the descent gradually allow the 
mast to descend horizontally to the ground in the opposite 
direction of the guy rope being held (one person to guide the 
mast and second person to guide with guy rope). Do not 
allow the mast to topple uncontrolled during recovery.
2 Loosen off the guys 
slightly.
5 Unclip all 6 guy ropes from the perlon 
hoops and wind them up. Unclip the top 
collar and the secondary cuff.
6 Place the top of the mast against 
something firm to prevent it slipping.
3 Remove mast from 
End Cap. Remove 
pegs and move End 
Cap to one side.

7 Lift the bottom of the mast and roll it 
by hand from the base of the mast. 
Note – rolling up must be from the 
base of the mast (there is a label which 
indicates the bottom).
8 Return all the components 
to the bag.
